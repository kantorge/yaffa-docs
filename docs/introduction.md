# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of **YAFFA personal finance application**! YAFFA (Yet Another Free Financial Application) is a **free**, **open-source**, **self-hosted** web application, built with PHP, using Laravel framework. It is designed to help you track your income and expenses, with a focus on supporting long term planning and forecasting.

As a self-hosted application, YAFFA does not require you to upload and share your financial data with any third-parties. You can install it on your own computer or server, and have full control over your data. This makes YAFFA a great choice for those who are concerned about privacy and security. On the other hand, you need to have some technical knowledge to install and maintain the application.

This documentation is intended to help you install, configure and use YAFFA. It is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of the application.
